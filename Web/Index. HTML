Ok. What to say? I'm pretty sure you know I'm just wasting space and time. Like this: SPACE AND TIME SPACE AND TIME SPACE AND TIME SPACE AND TIMES SPACE AND TIME SPACE AND TIME SPACE AND TIME SPACE AND TIME SPACE AND TIME SPACE AND TIME SPACE AND TIME SPACE AND TIME SPACE AND TIME SPACE AND TIMES PACE AND TIME SPACE AND TIMESPACE AND TIME SPACE AND TIME SPACE AND TIME SPACE AND TIME SPACE AND TIME SPACE AND TIME SPACE AND TIME
And the funny thing is, you can waste the words, while at the same time wasting the actual thing.
