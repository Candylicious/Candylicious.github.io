<h1>RANDOM WEBSITE WHICH PROBABLY CONTAINS A VIRUS</h1>

</head>

<body>

(and yes, I said virus. Don't judge. Someone could hack onto here and put one on. What did your teacher say about not going onto random websites? But anyway...)Okay. What to say?  I'm pretty sure you know I'm just wasting space and time.<br> Like this: <i>SPACE AND TIME SPACE AND TIME SPACE AND TIME SPACE AND TIMES SPACE AND TIME SPACE AND TIME SPACE AND TIME SPACE AND TIME SPACE AND TIME SPACE AND TIME SPACE AND TIME SPACE AND TIME SPACE AND TIME SPACE AND TIMES SPACE AND TIME SPACE AND TIMESPACE AND TIME SPACE AND TIME SPACE AND TIME SPACE AND TIME SPACE AND TIME SPACE AND TIME SPACE AND TIME </i> </br>
And the funny thing is, you can waste the words, while at the same time wasting the actual thing. Ya know, when you repeat words over and over again, it starts to lose meaning. Try it you idiot. Sorry, <i> random person.</i> No offence, but its hard to remember that you aren't <i>that</i> stupid, you're just really stupid. Oh, and if you're Audrey, no, I don't mean you. Sorry Annika. :( <br> <p>

Ok, now back to scolding you about viruses. <br> <b> YOU'RE SO STUPID OPENING A <h2> VIRUS </h2>CONTAINING WEBSITE! WAIT NO, FORGET I SAID ANYTHING ABOUT VIRUSES. DEFINITELY NO VIRUSES HERE. ;P.</b> <p> By the way, who said anything about viruses? I know I didn't. You did. You put a virus on this website? *gasp* Look. If you're hacking onto this website, you need a life. Yes, a life. God, you're so dense you don't even know what a life is. Get one at Yemen. Or something. <b> Because this website ain't worth hacking onto! Yesh, its not worth your time! God. I keep forgetting you're not right in the head.</b> *sigh* <p>

Really, I should call this website a Life getting manual for idiots. And yes, Isaac, you can deny deny deny. But it's not going to make a difference is it?<p>

Most American cars honk in the note of F. Reindeer like to eat bananas.
No word in the English language rhymes with month, orange, silver and purple. Mel Blanc (the voice of Bugs Bunny) was allergic to carrots. More people are killed annually by donkeys than airplane crashes. Studies have shown that children laugh an average of 300 times/day and adults 17 times/day, making the average child more optimistic, curious, and creative than the adult. Coca-Cola was originally green. Statues in parks: If the horse has both front legs in the air, the person died in battle; if the horse has one front leg in the air, the person died as a result of wounds received in battle; if the horse has all four legs on the ground, the person died of natural causes. Hershey's Kisses are called that because the machine that makes them looks like it's kissing the conveyor belt. Most toilets flush in E flat. It is illegal to eat oranges while bathing in California.101 Dalmatians, Peter Pan, Lady and the Tramp, and Mulan are the only Disney cartoons where both parents are present and don't die throughout the movie. That just reminds me. (By the way, this is the section dedicated to useless facts for the geek next door.) Okay, which movie does a family get brutally murdered, leaving just a young son and his father, and in which the son gets kidnapped, leaving the father to go on a death defying journey to find him? (including a close encounter with a toilet.) Ugh. You don't get it, do you? Finding Nemo! And don't say I don't have a life collecting useless facts. This is the closest you're ever going to get to a life. <p>

PUH-LEASE. NO JUDGING. IS IT THAT HARD TO UNDERSTAND? I mean, look at me. And now look at you. See the difference. You do? OMG I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU FAILED THE IQ TEST! I CAN ACTUALLY BUT STILL... OF COURSE YOU CAN'T SEE ME! YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW ME! GOD, WHAT AM I TO DO WITH YOU? You're just like Cheryl. Cheryl, the Cheryl I know, Cheryl my annoying younger sister. And yes, I called you annoying. This really is a useful website. To you. Not to me. <p>

I know I'm annoying you. Like, a lot. OMG. That just gave me an idea. Wait for it, wait for it... Ta-da! <h1>THE ANNOYING WEBSITE</h1> <p>

Isn't it beautiful? <p>

Yes, I know. It's fantastical, just plain ol' SHUMAZING. Thank you, thank you. *takes imaginary bow* "You've all been so supportive in the making of this wonderful website. Or should I say, NOT!" But let's just pretend you were supported. It makes me so much happier that way. :) <p>

If you're reading this text, I don't see why you'd really bother. There <i>is</i> a lot of text after all.
